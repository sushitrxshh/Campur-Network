# Campur-Network
This project simulates a campus network using Cisco Packet Tracer with a hierarchical design (Core, Distribution, Access). VLANs segment labs, classrooms, admin offices, and hostel areas for security and efficiency. Inter-VLAN routing via a multilayer switch enables controlled communication, creating a scalable and realistic campus network model.
